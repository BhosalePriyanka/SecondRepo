<p> SMPS is a tight-knit team building software & recruitment consultant in Glasgow, We are working since 2017, our actual work is designing and building software.</p>
<P> We are focused on customer service & business consultancy. SMPS grew year-on-year during the recession, thanks to our loyal customers and talented software engineers.</P>
<p> We take on complex, demanding projects that others will not: 25% of our work is on projects that were over-ambitious for the original development company and need to be rescued. We are sector and software agnostic, which means that we work with clients from many different industries and don't limit our work to just one or two programming languages. Four out of five of our customers undertake more than one project with us, and most have been with us for five years or more.</p>
